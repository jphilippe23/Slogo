# slogo

A development environment that helps users write SLogo programs.


Miguel Anderson, Yuansong Feng, Mina Mungekar, and Juan Philippe


2/16/17-3/11/17


Number of hours worked per team member is approximately 80 (conservatively, I'm willing to say)


Miguel worked on developing the front-end and controller classes as well as the refactoring and writing of commands. Feng contributed
to the interpreter and parser and assisted in developing custom and variable commands. Mina, developing the back-end as well, worked on 
the parsing, interpreting, and writing of commands. Juan designed the overall command library, worked on the project's structure, and wrote commands.
All contributed to extension work.


We used several online resources to help us identify tools we could use; among these were StackOverflow and Java documentation. 


The class Main.java can be run to launch the program.


The project was primarily tested manually; however, the program was run on a sample of the example files contained in the 'data' folder.


No files are required by the project but the properties files contained in the source folder. The program has the capacity to be run on any ".logo" file
contained in the example folder.


The user can select any one of the example data files on which to run the project; additionally, he or she can add multiple turtles to the screen and direct them through specialized commands.
also use shorthand of parenthesis, "()", to enter in commands which hold unlimited parameters. The program also supports the selection of multiple languages and user-interface controls
through tabs, buttons,and even the command line. The user can input a string of Logo commands through the terminal and either press Shift+Enter to submit the text, or push the 'Submit' button.
The user is also able to press the 'Up' arrow to view a previous submission and check the 'History' tab in the view to check a list of previously entered commands.


The program will not parse the user input correctly unless spaces are entered in between each word or special character; additionally, the program will occasionally have trouble
parsing user-input custom commands. Syntax must be carefully followed.


This project features the ability to control and maneuver multiple turtles; furthermore, several additional commands controlling UI-elements can be entered in the terminal.
Other features include the ability to designate commands with an unlimited number of parameters.
