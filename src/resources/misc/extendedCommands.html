<h3>SLogo  Extended Commands</h3>

<h4>Display Commands</h4>
<p>Note, for commands below that receive/return an index number, that index should refer to a list of  graphical items (like an image or color) whose items are clearly available in the GUI with their number or order apparent (so the user knows how to refer  to them within a command). Also, it would be helpful to populate each list with some initial default choices for the user.</p>

<h4>Additional Command Notes</h4>
<h5>Multiple turtles</h5>
<p>Since different versions of Logo handle multiple turtles differently your team will some flexibility in how you choose to implement TELL/ASK. For example, these commands are the only way to make new turtles, so you may want to adopt the shorthand used by newer versions of Logo to create LOTS of turtles:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>tell [ 100 ]</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>When the original Logo supported multiple turtles, this command simply created a second turtle (with IDs 1 and 100), but most modern versions simply create all the turtles up to that value (i.e., 99 additional turtles). Document your team's decision on how to handle this.</p>
<p>Additionally,  your team will need to clarify  when the evaluation of command arguments occur because it affects the results with multiple turtles. Consider the following code examples:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>set :x 10
tell [ 1 2 3 ]
# this command is only executed once
set :x * :x :x 
# all turtles move the same distance
fd :x</pre>
  <pre>set :x 10
# team decision: do all turtles move the same distance or different?
# i.e., is the variable's value set once and passed to fd or evaluated each time FD is run
fd set :x + :x 10</pre>
  <pre>set :x 10
# all turtles definitely each move different distances 
# since ID always returns the value of the current turtle running the command
fd * id :x</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>To be clear, using TELL/ASK is <em>not</em> the same as writing a loop, not all commands are run for each turtle &mdash; just the turtle commands. In the second example, if your team evaluates the arguments once and passes the values to the command, then it would make sense that the turtles all move the same distance. On the other hand, if the command evaluates its arguments, then it would make sense for the variable to get set multiple times. In short, please do not try to look at what the arguments to a command are to decide how many times to run it, your code will become a nightmare.</p>
<p>Note, that the last command must return a different value for each turtle, since the &quot;active&quot; turtle changes each time FD is run. Thus, your ID command (and any turtle query command in general) should be smart enough to always return its own value no matter when you evaluate your arguments.</p>
<p>Lastly, commands like SETPC and SETSH are not turtle specifi and change their settings for all future commands for all turtles (until another one is called). So if you want it to be set differently for different turtles then you have to specifically change it for each turtle (i.e., in a loop) or set it to a value based on ID.</p>
<h5>Unlimited parameters</h5>
<p>It is sometimes more convenient for users to pass multiple parameters to one command than to compose multiple calls together to achieve the same affect. Thus, like Logo, add syntactic sugar to allow programmers to pass an unlimited number of parameters to commands.</p>
<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <td>( <em>command</em> <em>expression(s)</em> )</td>
    <td>allows <em>command</em> to take any number of <em>expressions</em> as parameter values<br />
      note, this syntax is legal for any command, but only makes sense for a few commands (e.g., <code>sum</code>, <code>difference</code>, <code>product</code>, <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, etc.)</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p>For example, the following are equivalent:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre># ugly way to go FD 100
fd sum sum sum 10 20 30 40
# arguably cleaner way to go FD 100
fd ( sum 10 20 30 40 )
# goes FD four times (or you can combine the values and just go FD 100 once)
( fd 10 20 30 40 )</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>If the command already takes mulitple arguments then it is just like calling the command multiple times and you will need to error check that you get a correct multiple of arguments and that they are always in the right order. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre># move turtle around the screen
( setxy 10 20 300 400 0 100 )
# set multiple colors at once
( setpalette 10 255 0 0 11 0 255 0 12 0 0 255 )
# error, no last value for the variable
( set :x 100 :y 200 :z )
# legal, but really only the last one is relevant
( towards 100 100 20 10 )</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>Document your team's decision on how to handle unlimited arguments for ambiguous situations.</p>
<h5>Recursion</h5>
<p>Recursion is tricky because it requires the parser to recognize the command being  defined (and its parameter count) as valid syntax before the command's own parsing is complete. If your parser can accommodate this, then you do not need the DEFINE command described below; however, it may be useful to use it to help get around that problem. Document your team's decision on this (and what happens if the user never decides to implement the defined command).</p>

<table border="1">
  <tr>
    <td><code>DEFINE <em>commandName<br />
    </em> [ <em>parameter(s)</em> ]</code><code></code></td>
    <td>defines  <em>command</em><em>Name</em> as a command that WILL BE created in the future, but has not yet been<br />
      returns 1 if command is successfully defined, otherwise 0</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<h5>Variable Scope </h5>
<p>The original language Logo is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_%28programming%29#Dynamic_scoping">dynamically scoped</a>: that is, each function call inherits all the variables (and parameters) from the calling function. So you can write something like this:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <pre>
TO square [ ] [
   REPEAT 4 [ FD :size RT 90 ]
]

TO triangle [ :size ] [
   REPEAT 3 [ FD :size RT 120 ]
]

TO house [ ] [
   SET :size 100
   square
   FD :size
   RT 60
   triangle 80
   FD :size
]</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>In <code>square</code>, <code>:size</code> is inherited from its calling function (so its value is 100), <code>house</code> but, in <code>triangle</code>, <code>:size</code>, is defined by the parameter which overrides the more remote declaration in <code>house</code> (so its value is 80). Then in the last command <code>:size</code> is its original value again (100). In both cases, <code>:size</code> goes out of scope after the procedures are done executing (which is different than your current implementation in which all variables are global). You can write some really bad code using dynamic scoping, with lots of magic side effects and unforeseen runtime errors, but Logo is not meant for writing large programs so it usually does not come up and can produce some useful effects.</p>
